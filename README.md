Approach to Build Form in React
To create a form in React we will structure the form with HTML inputs, add styles using CSS, manage input state using useState, and handle form data updates via onChange events.

this form is divided into 3 steps

1. Personal Information
2. Education Information
3. Additional Information

and each step has its own set of inputs and validation rules.
